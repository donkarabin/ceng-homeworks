I) 12 ICMP echo requests sent by traceroute. TTL fields
of these requests started by ttl=1 and incremented one-by-
one for each request up to ttl=12 for the last(12th) request.
However TTL fields of responses exceeded, values was around 250,
but the last response was not exceeded value is ttl=55.


II) NO of TTL-              Source IP addresses:
    exceeded responses:           
    1) ------------  11. ---- 144.122.24.1
    2) ------------  13. ---- 144.122.2.1
    3) ------------  15. ---- 144.122.1.21
    4) ------------  17.---- 193.140.85.137
    5) ------------  19.---- 213.194.75.25
    6) ------------  21.---- 31.145.74.162
    7) ------------  23.---- 46.234.28.57
    8) ------------  25.---- 195.2.23.129
    9) ------------  27.---- 195.2.27.149
    10)------------  29.---- 195.2.16.1
    11)------------  31.---- 23.235.41.162

   Comparison: The output of traceroute command shows 12
output with source IP addresses of the responses and time in
ms. Hovewer first 11 of these outputs are TTL-exceeded respon-
ses , the 12th output is the not exceeded response. But info 
about TTL-exceeded responses is not specified in the output,
on the other hand, wireshark shows us this info that which res-
ponse is TTL-exceeded or not.


III) Traceroute sends packets using ICMP. First packets ttl value
starts with 1. There are some routers between our IP address and the
address of where we want to reach. When encontering with the router, router is decreasing ttl=1 to ttl=0 , then it sends ttl exceeded response to our device with the header that contains its source IP add-ress. Then traceroute sends next packet with ttl=2 to the router that it already has the IP address. Then the first router decreases ttl=2 to ttl=1 and forwards to the next hop (router). Second router also decreases ttl=1 to ttl=0 and TTL-exceeded response will go to our device, again 
with the header containing source IP address of that router. Same procedure continues until it reaches the destination website or address. 
     The knowledge from my several experiments to find route to same address, from same network/location is that the route is not changed.
Hovewer the route can be changed if destination hop(router) has two or
more connection to different ISPs and when load balancing occured.

IV) IP Header length is 20 bytes, total length is 85.

V) Protocol field value is 17 for UDP, for ICMP value is 1.

VI) Yes , fragmented. 4 fragments used , first 3 fragment is of
1480 bytes (whole package 1514 bytes), the last one is ~588 bytes,
because 5000 bytes was the size of ping request.
